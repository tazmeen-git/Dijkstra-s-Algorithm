# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
This repository provides an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a randomly generated graph. It also integrates charging points along the route, making it suitable for applications such as electric vehicle (EV) routing, logistics, and transportation networks.

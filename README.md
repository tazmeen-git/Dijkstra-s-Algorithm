# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
This repository provides an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a randomly generated graph.Making it suitable for applications such as electric vehicle (EV) routing, logistics, and transportation networks.The code is an implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm using python while considering Intermediate charging points in between the random graph providing us with shortest path.The graph is visualized using NetworkX & Matplotlib.
